# Test Reliability Improvements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the remaining test failures in the Gowright testing framework and implements improvements to ensure reliable test execution in CI/CD environments. The current test failures are:

1. `TestTestAssertion_Integration` - Assertion integration test failing due to log parsing issues
2. `TestBrowserPool_Acquire_ContextCancelled` - Browser pool context cancellation not working as expected
3. `TestBrowserPool_Integration_AcquireAndRelease` - Browser pool integration test with resource management issues

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Assertion Integration Test

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the assertion integration test to pass consistently, so that I can trust the assertion system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the assertion integration test runs THEN it SHALL parse log entries correctly
2. WHEN counting log entries THEN the system SHALL handle different log formats consistently
3. WHEN validating test results THEN the assertion system SHALL provide accurate counts
4. IF log parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Fix Browser Pool Context Cancellation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want browser pool context cancellation to work properly, so that resources are managed correctly when operations are cancelled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a context is cancelled during browser acquisition THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
2. WHEN context cancellation occurs THEN browser resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
3. WHEN the browser pool detects cancelled context THEN it SHALL not return browser instances
4. IF browser creation is in progress during cancellation THEN the system SHALL handle cleanup gracefully

### Requirement 3: Fix Browser Pool Integration Test

**User Story:** As a developer, I want browser pool integration tests to pass reliably, so that I can trust the browser resource management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN acquiring multiple browsers THEN the pool SHALL track them correctly
2. WHEN releasing browsers THEN the pool SHALL make them available for reuse
3. WHEN browser health checks fail THEN the system SHALL handle cleanup appropriately
4. IF browser instances become invalid THEN the pool SHALL detect and replace them
5. WHEN running in test environments THEN browser operations SHALL be reliable and deterministic

### Requirement 4: Improve Test Environment Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run reliably in different environments, so that CI/CD pipelines are stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in headless mode THEN they SHALL behave consistently
2. WHEN running in CI environments THEN browser tests SHALL handle resource constraints
3. WHEN tests run concurrently THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
4. IF system resources are limited THEN tests SHALL adapt gracefully
5. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear diagnostic information

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Test Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want better test diagnostics when failures occur, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture relevant state information
2. WHEN browser operations fail THEN detailed error context SHALL be provided
3. WHEN resource management issues occur THEN the system SHALL log diagnostic information
4. IF tests are flaky THEN the system SHALL provide insights into the root cause
5. WHEN running test suites THEN progress and status SHALL be clearly reported

### Requirement 6: Test Isolation and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to be properly isolated and cleaned up, so that test results are reliable and resources don't leak.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN all allocated resources SHALL be cleaned up
2. WHEN tests fail THEN cleanup SHALL still occur to prevent resource leaks
3. WHEN running multiple tests THEN they SHALL not share state inappropriately
4. IF cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log warnings but not fail the test
5. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN resource allocation SHALL be thread-safe
