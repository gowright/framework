# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Gowright is a comprehensive testing framework for Go that provides unified testing capabilities across UI (browser, mobile), API, database, and integration testing scenarios. The framework will be built as a reusable package that can be integrated into different projects, featuring a flexible reporting system that supports multiple report portals and local reporting formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified testing framework that supports multiple testing types (UI, API, database, integration), so that I can use a single tool for all my testing needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports the Gowright package THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces for UI, API, database, and integration testing
2. WHEN a test is executed THEN the system SHALL support browser automation using go-rod/rod
3. WHEN a test is executed THEN the system SHALL support mobile UI testing capabilities
4. WHEN an API test is created THEN the system SHALL use go-resty/resty for HTTP client operations
5. WHEN assertions are needed THEN the system SHALL integrate stretchr/testify for common assertions and mocks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write tests with familiar assertion patterns, so that I can leverage existing Go testing knowledge and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing test assertions THEN the system SHALL provide testify-compatible assertion methods
2. WHEN creating mocks THEN the system SHALL support testify mock functionality
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL integrate with Go's standard testing package
4. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, descriptive error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform browser automation testing, so that I can validate web application functionality end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating browser tests THEN the system SHALL provide a Chrome DevTools Protocol interface using go-rod/rod
2. WHEN interacting with web elements THEN the system SHALL support element selection, clicking, typing, and navigation
3. WHEN capturing browser state THEN the system SHALL support screenshots and page source extraction
4. WHEN running browser tests THEN the system SHALL handle browser lifecycle management automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test APIs efficiently, so that I can validate REST endpoints and HTTP services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL use go-resty/resty as the underlying client
2. WHEN testing REST APIs THEN the system SHALL support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods
3. WHEN validating responses THEN the system SHALL provide JSON, XML, and plain text response handling
4. WHEN testing authenticated APIs THEN the system SHALL support various authentication methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test database operations, so that I can validate data persistence and retrieval functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to databases THEN the system SHALL support multiple database drivers
2. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL provide query execution and result validation capabilities
3. WHEN testing transactions THEN the system SHALL support transaction management and rollback
4. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL provide database-specific assertion methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible reporting options, so that I can integrate test results with different reporting systems and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate reports in JSON format locally
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate reports in HTML format locally
3. WHEN configured THEN the system SHALL send reports to Jira Xray
4. WHEN configured THEN the system SHALL send reports to AIOTest
5. WHEN configured THEN the system SHALL send reports to Report Portal
6. WHEN multiple report destinations are configured THEN the system SHALL support sending to multiple portals simultaneously

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Gowright as a reusable package, so that I can integrate it into multiple projects without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing Gowright THEN the system SHALL be available as a Go module package
2. WHEN using in different projects THEN the system SHALL provide a stable public API
3. WHEN configuring the framework THEN the system SHALL support project-specific configuration
4. WHEN updating versions THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for public interfaces

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration testing capabilities, so that I can test complex workflows that span multiple systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating integration tests THEN the system SHALL support combining UI, API, and database operations in a single test
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL provide test orchestration and sequencing
3. WHEN integration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure context across all involved systems
4. WHEN setting up integration tests THEN the system SHALL support test data setup and teardown
